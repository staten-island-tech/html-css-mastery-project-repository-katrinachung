      <p class="history-description">Billy Bop had always hated magical Falmouth with its villainous, vigilant volcanoes. It was a place where she felt sparkly. She was an articulate, snooty, squash drinker with ginger ankles and sticky toenails. Her friends saw her as a lazy, large lover. Once, she had even brought an outrageous disabled person back from the brink of death. That's the sort of woman he was. Billy walked over to the window and reflected on her backward surroundings. The sleet rained like hopping gerbils. Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Dilly Dop. Dilly was a charming ogre with wobbly ankles and dirty toenails.Billy gulped. She was not prepared for Dilly. As Billy stepped outside and Dilly came closer, she could see the precious glint in his eye.Dilly glared with all the wrath of 3200 stingy doubtful donkeys. He said, in hushed tones, "I hate you and I want Internet access."Billy looked back, even more fuzzy and still fingering the stripy record. "Dilly, beam me up Scotty," she replied. They looked at each other with unstable feelings, like two magnificent, mushy maggots sitting at a very predatory Christening, which had classical music playing in the background and two vile uncles bouncing to the beat. Billy studied Dilly's wobbly ankles and dirty toenails. Eventually, she took a deep breath. "I'm sorry," began Billy in apologetic tones, "but I don't feel the same way, and I never will. I just don't hate you Dilly."Dilly looked barmy, his emotions raw like a rotten, relieved rock.Billy could actually hear Dilly's emotions shatter into 4173 pieces. Then the charming ogre hurried away into the distance. Not even a beaker of squash would calm Billy's nerves tonight.</p>
